# Todo list
#------------>

1. Setup a basic level or room. 
    - Made a blend file, need to add the collid props.
  ! - Need to redo the current room, since the "wall" collisions are up too shit.

2. Setup a basic first person camera
    - Done: Used snip code from Treeform

3. Setup the basic movement with the camera
    - Done:

4. Setup some basic collision detection
    - Done: But I think the level's "collider" props are setup wrong, makes the PC jump around when colliding with wall, or sometimes the player would go 
	pass the wall.
