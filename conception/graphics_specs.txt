Technical specifications (only graphics there) :


What We Have :

Volumetric lighting 
For opaque, semi-transparent or transparent objects (we can choose volumetric shadow color and volumetric light color).
Add depth to scene, good for immersion and wow effect.
Easy to implement, working code ready, not much gpu power required.

Volumetric dust
Better vizualize 3-dimensional space/scene, using volum. light. code actually.
Can have dust, metal particles, whatever particles, space tornadoes, hull breach...
Pre-computed animations done in Blender.
Requires some time to export from Blender to Panda3D.

Depth of field
Add immersion + wow effect.
For cutscenes, title screens, introduction...
Requires some GPU power.
Easy to implement, code already working.
Can get some people dizzy or cause eye-strain.

Shadows
Depth map shadows.
Default shadows from Panda3D or custom code for directional lights (paralell shadows code working).
No 360Â° shadows (point lights) at the moment.

Lighting
Deferred lighting custom => no transparency, more work
	or 
Fixed pipeline => transparency, easy texturing (gloss, normal, specular, albedo..)


What We Need
Custom shader for metal (anisotropic specular), in worst case we can use Strauss lighting model.
Project a fake holographic GUI on a plane / model.
Custom shader for glass / windows with simple or complex reflexions (can re-use water shader code).
