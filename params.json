{"name":"Ecliptic Space","body":"## Welcome.\r\n_2124_:  Preserved for many years within a cryonics pod, you finally wake up unfrozen and somehow still alive.\r\nNo memories, all but a little piece of paper crumbled; saying “_earth, is hopelessly lost_”\r\n\r\nEcliptic Space is a puzzle-rpg mixture.  This “_rpg_” won't have any physical combat, but all mental combat.  You are alone and all have been lost around you and the places yet to be discovered.  Overcome puzzles to gain victory.  Find your identity and discover your destiny.\r\n***\r\n## Art.\r\n### Quick Concepts made by @Manou1\r\n* Orbital Station Concept\r\n![Station_orbital - concept](http://www.64digits.com/users/Manou/station_orbitale_1.jpg)\r\n* Ship Interior Concept 1\r\n![Ship_interior concept](http://www.64digits.com/users/Manou/interior.jpg)\r\n* Ship Interior Concept 2\r\n![Ship_exterior concept](http://www.64digits.com/users/Manou/ship_outside.jpg)\r\n* Shop pattern fonts (Not for reading)\r\n![Ship_pattern Fonts (not for reading) concept](http://www.64digits.com/users/Manou/typo.png)\r\n\r\n### Panda3d renders and testing by @Manou1\r\n![deferred shading](http://s15.postimage.org/abu6hksef/wip_1.jpg)\r\n![depth of field](http://s15.postimage.org/fyqjf1ux3/blur.gif)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n* Development: @MJ-meo-dmt\r\n* Art/Effects ++: @Manou1\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nHop on IRC @ #Ecliptic-space","tagline":"2124","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
