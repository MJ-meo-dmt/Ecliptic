> MJ-meo-dmt

- Added bullet physics, works with movement and camera view.  Only crouch needs work.
- Looks like the collisions.py won't be needed anymore, but I'll keep it for incase, we need some thing.
- Started with picking up objects, so far no good.

28/05/2012
> MJ-meo-dmt

- Added alot of changes.
- New egg parser added, also game_prop.py for the base classes to handle the creation of items via parser.
- Cleaned up code[still not 100%]
- Moved code around, like player bullet setup.  Moved to Player.py instead of physics.py
- Removed old Collisions.py
- Picking objects still needs work, since if player is to0-close to object [PC] gets pushed backwards.
- Parser and object setup need tweaking for detailed setups. like Bullet setup(mass, shape...)
