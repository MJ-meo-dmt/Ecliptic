---------------------->

17/05/2012
> MJ-meo-dmt

- Added bullet physics, works with movement and camera view.  Only crouch needs work.
- Looks like the collisions.py won't be needed anymore, but I'll keep it for incase, we need some thing.
- Started with picking up objects, so far no good.

28/05/2012
> MJ-meo-dmt

- Added alot of changes.
- New egg parser added, also game_prop.py for the base classes to handle the creation of items via parser.
- Cleaned up code[still not 100%]
- Moved code around, like player bullet setup.  Moved to Player.py instead of physics.py
- Removed old Collisions.py
- Parser and object setup need tweaking for detailed setups. like Bullet setup(mass, shape...)
- Looks like picking up works fine now :D (Will finalize this)

31/05/2012
> MJ-meo-dmt

- Made some changes to the parser, added some stuff
- Added extras under the game_prop.py aswell: aka FLOOR, WALL
- Added the solid setup aka: bulletHelper for wall and floor collision Node setups
- Added a little 'cheat sheet' containing the tag usage in blender
- Note that <Collide> {Polyset keep Descend} Will be used for Walls maybe floors aswell (keep it simple though)
- Added a Room.egg(test room scale not correct :P) - by Jolein

01/06/2012

08/06/2012

20/06/2012
> MJ-meo-dmt

- Alot has changed.. Manou added his filter and buffersystem
- Most of the code changed aswell to much to list. Kinda confusing atm...
- Problems atm:
  - Player collision is up to shit
  - Low end pc's suffer to run the game
  - Event System setup is still useless(basic)
  - Object Parser works fine now, still lights setup is not perfect well nothing is...
- I (mj) is busy sorting out the Player.py trying to get the player collisions to work right, as for the eventsystem to be added under objects
