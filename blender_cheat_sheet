## TAGS ##

# !!! NOTE:  Don't add CTRL+A "Loc" to lights other wise the position can't be found/used
# !!! NOTE:  Don't add CTRL+A "scale" to sensors other wise the scale can't be used for BulletGhost shape

# MAIN TAGS FOR PARSER #
#------#
# THESE TWO ARE VERY DEPENDED ON APPLYING 'loc+rot+scale' IN BLENDER
FLOOR 					- Floor_Name
WALL					- Wall_Name
#------#
SENSOR					- Sensor_Name/Number  # Used for lights, and other moments * DON'T apply scale on SENSORS!!
DOOR					- Door_Name/Number # Place holder for DYNAMIC DOOR objects
PLAYER					- Player_Spawn(This would be the spawn point)
TRIGGER					- Trigger_Name/Number # Used for things the player interact with, switch, buttons stuff
LIGHT					- Light_Name/Number # Any lights
ITEM					- Item_Name/Number # Any items: These if pickable would be in seperate egg files.
SCREEN					- Screen_Name/Number
PARTICLES				- Particle_Name/Number # Places particles may spawn
SUIT					- Suit_Name(This would be for something todo with the suit)
DECOR					- Decor_Name/Number 

# SUB TAGS #
# These get used under the created object(class) and then stored in DICT

# FLOOR AND WALL SPECIFICS
Collide 				- Polyset keep Descend
# --------#
NAME 					- From First Tag# This is the getTag from the MAIN Tag.  Say SENSOR = Sensor0 which then gets used as the Name
TYPE					- STATIC / DYNAMIC / GHOST # LIGHTS # = POINT / DYNAMIC / SPOT etc
TRIGGERS				- "triggers" = # The object this object TRIGGERS: Light01
AREA					- The Area this object is found within: Area0(Ship interior)
PICKABLE				- True/False: Bool
NEEDS					- "needs" = # The object or player this object needs before being enabled: Status=True
STATUS					- True/False = On/Off
SOUNDON					- The STRING "dir" # Pointing to the sound file for this object's ON sound 
SOUNDOFF				- The STRING "dir" # Pointing to the sound file for this object's OFF sound - If no OFF sound avail leave blank 
STYLE					- The STRING "name" for the style found in the STYLE_File.something
PHYSICS					- float = 0.0 to =mass for the object.
BITMASK					- 0x0  : Hex
PARENT					- The parent this object belongs to.

# Object specifics: Lights
RED					- The "red" color: 0.0 -> 1.0
GREEN					- The "green" color: 0.0 -> 1.0
BLUE					- The "blue" color: 0.0 -> 1.0
POWER					- The "power" 0.0 -> 1.0
